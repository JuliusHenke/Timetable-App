# Timetable-App
This is a timetable App for android phones. 
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=juliushenke.smarttt

When launced, this app is supposed to show you the timetable of one day in a smart, fast and simple way. 
This means the current DAY_OF_WEEK is detected and settings like how long your week is and if it is odd/even are also taken into consideration.
Nevertheless you can also swipe to the left and right to see the timetable for upcoming days or for those in the past...

Future plans:
Our goal is to implement more features like managment of homework, grades and events. For a more detailed view look at the Projects-Section.
