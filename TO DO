This is the to do list!

Main points:
- new configurable option: setCurDay() shows the next day when a specific time is reached
- show (tomorrow, yeserday) instead of the date in TF_main_date
- Widget support
- Action bar (to replace these buttons wtih icons: B_main_options, B_main_editMode)
- redesign activity_options
- rework even/odd week system for more compability

Future / less urgent points:
- homework feature
- grades feature
- events/calendar feature
- more translations (localization)
